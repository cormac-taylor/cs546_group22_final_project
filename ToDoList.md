# To Do

### Cormac
##### Key
- Route : description
- \* : make prettier if have time
- \* validate html
- \* make header dynamic or at least make the routing more intuitive (the button are bit odd to use in their current placment)
- / : home should have info; either add new content or make see events or community the home 
- / : rename "Create Account" to  "Sign Up" for consistancy
- / : discover and community should probably have the same access; either need account or don't
- / : add signout button
- /signup : should not be accessable when signed in
- /sigin : add client side validation
- /signup : add client side validation
- /signup : route to the sign in page after sign up
- /signup : make sure all data is collected; address currently isn't
- /dashboard/:username/update : make sure that user can't select default attribute
- /dashboard/:username/update : maybe password should only be updated at /login as forgot password
- /dashboard/:username/update : feild and value should persist through invalid input
- /dashboard/:username/update : everything should route back to user dashboard not home
- /dashboard/:username/update : probably best to offer a link to the dashboard
- /dashboard/:username/update : updating password doesn't work
- /dashboard/:username/update : updating username if user's should let them know its theirs
- /dashboard/:username/update : updating username should route to dashbord or something to get them off the page so that the url updates
- /community : buttons dont do anything with new user at least
- /manage/addGame2 : unhandled error when no games come up Ex. ovienronvoerno
